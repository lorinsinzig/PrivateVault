# PrivateVault
A simple vault plugin for Minecraft Spigot Servers

PrivateVault is a simple plugin that aims to improve survival servers by adding a private vault for all players.
You can access the private vault via </vault>, which then opens the player specific vault.

Currently, all inventory data is stored in a file <config.yml>.
THis will get changed in the future, the aim is to store all data in a database like MySQL, so it is stored online.

Disclaimer: This is my first plugin, and, in addition, this project is meant for my own edicational purpose.
